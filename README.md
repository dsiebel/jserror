#jserror

Demonstration files accompanying @toddhgardner's "Traces of Errors" talk. This is a series of demonstrations on:

* The JavaScript Error Object
* The DOM Global Error Handler
* How errors bubble
* How errors bubble through callbacks
* Example of wrapping callbacks

##Setup

This project uses node to host a simple web server for hosting the files. You must have node installed.

* `npm install`
* `grunt`

The server listens on localhost:3000
